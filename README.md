# Personal-Website-Homepage

Free to use personal website homepage, features one page which is easy to read and customise for those who just want something to populate their domain.

## Usage

The style.css file has a few variables defined, these can be easily changed to a HEX code of your choosing.

The index.html has a few links (gallery, contact, twitter, instagram, facebook) that need changing to be appropriate or removed.

icon.png should be set to an avatar, ideally square and not too big (400x400 is generous). Favicon.png should be set to that image, just a fair bit smaller (150x150 would be fine). Sizes don't need to be perfect.

## Support

Feel free to create an issue on this github repo if you have an issue.
